# Edit Example using React and Redux

Branch: main - Starting point of lecture

## Set up Data

- database.sql file

## Run App

- npm install
- npm run server
- npm run client

Am I adding a new thing? - POST
Or updating an existing thing? PUT and SQL UPDATE

How are the changes going to be store on the client side? Reducer?
How is the user going to make edits? Cancel edits? What will happen when the edit is done?
